This is a simple project built with React, it's meant to demonstrate the basic skills of React such as using state and props, creating modals and managing events, it's a simple project management tool that allows you to create and manage your projects and also to practice some basic styling concepts like using CSS modules and dynamic classes

I utilized several key features of React, such as the useState hook for managing component state, and the use of state and props to control rendering and pass data between components.

I also made use of a modal component, which is passed down as a child prop and rendered in response to a user action. Functions are used as props to handle events such as form submissions and cancelation actions.

For styling, I used a combination of global and component-specific stylesheets, as well as inline styles and dynamic inline styles to control the appearance of the different elements of the application. I also used CSS Modules, and conditional CSS classes to add some dynamic styling.

The form for creating new projects includes basic form validation, controls the inputs, and handles the onChange event to get access to written data in the form. Submitting the form outputs the submitted form to the list of projects and closes the modal.

The modal also has a scroll up and down property and added cancel button to the create project modal, So user can easily use it.

Overall, the Virtual Manufacturing Project Manager is a powerful tool for managing projects within a virtual manufacturing company, with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It allows users to create and manage projects, view and edit project details, and track progress all in one place.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
![Current-progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97854234/211147916-d89f1a7f-7cc0-44f5-8950-cc7c2557bb7a.png)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
